# TSP Visualizer

A web-based tool to visualize and solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with interactive controls and detailed step-by-step processing.

## Features

- **Night Mode**: Easily toggle between light and dark themes with the left button at the top of the screen.
- **GitHub Repository Access**: Access the GitHub repository for this project with the button on the right at the top.

## Getting Started

### Example Data
At the bottom of the screen, you will find two examples labeled **Example 1** and **Example 2**. These examples provide sample data that you can use to run the TSP algorithm. You are free to adjust the distances and the number of nodes in these examples.

### Running the TSP Algorithm
To start the algorithm, click on the **Start Processing** button. This will compute the optimal solution and display the:

- **Optimal Path**: The shortest route visiting each node exactly once and returning to the start.
- **Optimal Value**: The minimum possible distance.

### Step-by-Step Processing
For a detailed breakdown of each step in the TSP process:

1. Click on the **View Processing** button.
2. Controls will appear, including:
   - **Play**: Automatically play through each step of the TSP solution.
   - **Pause**: Pause the processing at any moment.
   - **Forward / Backward**: Manually step through the algorithm to view previous or next steps.

These controls let you interactively explore the algorithm's pathfinding process at your own pace.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository using the **GitHub Repository Access** button or by running:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
